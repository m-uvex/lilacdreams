  <h1>Happy Birthday, Meicy ðŸ©·</h1>

  <div class="section letter">
    <p>dear meicy,<br><br>
    i know we met in the most random way possible but somehow it feels like the most natural thing ever  
    in just a week, u became my safe place, my fav notification, my lil daydream and my cutie patootie  
    i never thought someone could get me like u do  
    the chaos, the millions of reels, the late-night convos about our future together â€” all of it means more than i let on<br><br>

    u make distance feel less distant, and waiting worth it  
    and even tho weâ€™re not in the same place, u still feel close  
    thank u for being u  
    happy birthday, my one and only love  
    this siteâ€™s a lil piece of my heart, just for u  
    hope u feel loved every time u see it  
    (<b>you better. i spent way too long on this just for you :3</b>)<br><br>

    â€” Your nerd</p>
